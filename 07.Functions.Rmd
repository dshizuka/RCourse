##1. Intro to making your own functions

Today we will learn a little bit about functions. This may be one of the most useful things you learn about R. Once you learn how to write your own functions, the world is your oyster. You will no longer be limited in your work by software—if no software does what you want or you don’t want to pay money for a piece of software, then just learn to write your own functions.

A function is basically a wrapper for one or a series of lines of code that you want to run with a given set of inputs. If there is not a pre-built function in R or any R package... you can write one yourself! The ability to write function is also really useful if you have some sort of routine that you need to run often. The syntax for writing a function is:

`function("input arguments") {"code for what to do with the inputs"}`

So, inside the `function()` parentheses, you will simply list the objects that you will use as inputs. That will be followed by a space and then the series of lines of code that the function will do. 

For example, here’s is a custom function for calculating the mean of a vector:

```{r}
mean.custom=function(x) sum(x)/length(x)
```

Now that you have made this, you can use it by simply using `mean.custom()` as a function.

Let's use this to calculate the mean of numbers 1 through 10:
```{r}
mean.custom(1:10)
```

##2. Using If-Else statements to add arguments inside functions

###2.1 What are arguments?
You will notice that many R functions have a set of arguments that you use to control how the function is executed. Take, for example the `plot()` function--it has a lot of arguments that can be used to change the output. 

Let's try plotting the change in atmospheric concentration of CO2 in two different ways. We know that this can be done with a simple argument, `type=`.

```{r, out.width="50%"}
plot(co2, type="p", pch=20) #with points
```

```{r, out.width="50%"}
plot(co2, type="l") #with a line
```

To add arguments to your custom function, you can add an input variable that will act as your argument, and then you need to include if-else statements inside your function to control the output.

###2.2 A digression into If-else statements

So, to include arguments into your custom functions, you will need to know a little bit about if-else statements. 
Let's start with the simple "If Statment". This follows a structure like this:

`if(condition) code`

This is going to execute the code if the condition = TRUE

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=F, fig.cap="The If statement", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/if.png")
```

Let's do an example:
Let's say we have an object called `answer`, that holds a number. We are going to make an 'if statement' that says, if `answer` is equal to the mean of the numbers 1 through 10, tell me I am correct.

Now try it with the correct answer, `answer=5.5`
```{r}
answer=5.5
if (answer==mean(1:10)) print("you are correct")
```


Now try it with a wrong answer:
```{r}
answer=5
if (answer==mean(1:10)) print("you are correct")
```

What you will find is that this will not give you any output. This is because the if statement only executes the code when the condition is true, and does not execute the code otherwise. 

To get an output when the answer is wrong, you need to use both an "If" statement and an "Else" statement. 

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=F, fig.cap="The If-Else statement", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/if-else.png")
```

Try this:

If-Else statement with correct answer
```{r}
answer=5.5
if (answer==mean(1:10)) print("you are correct") else print("you are incorrect")
```

If-Else statement with wrong answer
```{r}
answer=5
if (answer==mean(1:10)) print("you are correct") else print("you are incorrect")
```

Now, you can actually make this into a function:

```{r}
mean.1to10=function(answer) {if (answer==mean(1:10)) print("you are correct") else print("you are incorrect")}
```

```{r}
mean.1to10(answer=5.5)
mean.1to10(answer=5)
```

###2.3 Custom function with arguments

Ok, so now you kind of know how if-else statements work. Let's now build a better function for calculating averages. Let's say we want to be able to calculate the **geometric mean**, which is the *n*th root of the product of *n* numbers, as well as the arithmetic mean.

```{r}
average=function(x, type="arithmetic"){
  if(type=="arithmetic") sum(x)/length(x)
  else if(type=="geometric") prod(x)^(1/length(x))
}
```

Then, we can calculate the arithmetic or geometric mean easily:

```{r}
average(1:10, type="arithmetic")
average(1:10, type="geometric")
```

Note also that in the function, we have set the default type to be arithmetic:

```{r}
average(1:10)
```

One problem is that, if we choose a different type of average, say median (or if we simply misspell the type), then the code simply won't run.

```{r}
average(1:10, type="median")
```

So a good practice is to also include an error message if something in the arguments doesn't work correctly. We can do this by layering another if-else statement below the previous one:

```{r}
average=function(x, type="arithmetic"){
  if(type=="arithmetic") sum(x)/length(x)
  else if (type=="geometric") prod(x)^(1/length(x))
  else "we can't handle that type of average"
}
```

Now:
```{r}
average(1:10, type="median")
```

##3. Building a custom function for measuring standard error of the mean

A common thing people find out about R is that there is no built-in function for calculating standard error of the mean, a pretty common statistic. There are probably a lot of theoretical reasons for that ('standard error' can mean different things to different people), but we won't delve into that. 

Standard Error of the Mean is simply the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. This is also equivalent to taking the square root of the variance divided by the sample size. So, let's make the function:

```{r}
se=function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
se(1:10)
```


Let's include in this function an option to remove NAs before calculating the standar error:
```{r}
se=function(x, na.rm=F) {
  if(na.rm==F) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
  else if (na.rm==T) sqrt(var(x[is.na(x)==F])/length(x[is.na(x)==F]))
}
```

Now we can calculate standard error and mean from some continuous variable. Let's take Petal Length from the `iris` dataset:

```{r}
means=tapply(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
ses=tapply(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, se)
means
ses
```


Let's use this to make barplots with error bars:

```{r}
p=barplot(means, ylim=c(0,6), las=1, ylab="Petal Length")
arrows(p, means+ses, p, means-ses, code=3, angle=90)
```
