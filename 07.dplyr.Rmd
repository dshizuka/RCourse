##1. Intro to `dplyr` and the 'tidyverse'

```{r, out.width="10%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hex-dplyr.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/hex-tidyr.png")
```

Now that we have dipped our feet into plots and stats in R, I think you are getting a better sense of the fact that 'wrangling' or 'manipulating' data is one of the biggest steps to becoming proficient in R and all that it has to offer. 

For example, for any given analysis, you may have to subset data, filter out certain data that don't meet some criteria, focus in on a select set of variables of interest, calculate means, and variance for different groups, etc. etc. 

These tasks are where the packages [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) and other packages in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)--a series of packages designed for all kinds of data tasks. This also includes the popular [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for graphics. 

The tidyverse packages are constructed by [Hadley Wickam](http://hadley.nz/). There are several books that cover how to use these packages, including *R for Data Science* [which is available for free as an online book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

```{r, out.width="20%", echo=F}

```


##2. What makes `dplyr` and `tidyverse` different?

* Piping `%>%`
* tibble
* functions that have special syntax -- but once you learn them, it's hard to go back.
