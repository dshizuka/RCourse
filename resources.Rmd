Now that you have taken this course and hopefully made it "over the hump" in getting started with R, here are a few tips on things you can do to keeping up (and improving) your R skills. 


###Tip 1: Keep practicing

**R is a language**, and like any language, you will lose your fluency if you don't use it. 

* #### #TidyTuesday

* #### Make your own "worked examples" of papers you read. This takes investment in time & energy, but it will be well worth it for what you will learn + the confidence you will gain!

###Tip 2: Useful (free) books

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", out.width="10%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/R_for_Data_Science_cover.png")
```

* #### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", out.width="10%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rbook.cover.gif")
```
* #### ***The R Book*** (Crawley) is available as electronic copy (downloadable as pdf) via the UNL library. Use [this link](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.unl.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9780470515075) for access (you'll probably need to log in using the library credentials).
