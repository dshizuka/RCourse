### This is the course website for **BIOS 967: Intro to R for Biologists**. I will post course modules here each week.

## Updates

* 9/5/19: In the "Formatting Data" module, I borrow heavily from the ["Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists"](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/) lesson from [datacarpentry.org](datacarpentry.org). I encourage you to go take a look at the lesson. 

* 8/29/19: **Assignment 1** Here is the [assignment file](pdfs/Assignment1.pdf) and an [example assignment folder](data/Assignment1_example.zip). This file includes a sample dataset and a sample readme file.


* 08/27/19: **Week 1!** Welcome to the course! First, we will go through some intros and course mechanics. Then, we will plan to get through Modules 1 and 2 (See ["Modules" page](modules.html)), which will get us up and running with R. There will be an assignment posted on Thursday, to be completed by Tuesday next week.
