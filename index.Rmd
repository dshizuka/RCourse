### This is the course website for **BIOS 967: Intro to R for Biologists**. I will post course modules here each week.

## Updates

* September 22: I made changes to the first data wrangling module so that it now focuses just on dplyr and uses the iris dataset instead of a more complex dataset.

* August 29: I changed up the order of the modules to put 'data wrangling' ahead of stats. I think this makes sense for this course. Note that I will updating some modules as I go...

* August 26: Here is the [google doc for live coding sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzvXYMHvwYf7ILJXUKGGuc96T_Oh4GYsS8CWcFgbEQ8/edit?tab=t.0)

* August 25, 2025: Welcome to BIOS 967 for Fall 2025! The syllabus has just recently been updated. If you looked at the syllabus earlier, take a look again now.
