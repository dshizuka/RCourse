## 1. The "apply-family" of functions

The "apply family" function--which includes `apply()`, `sapply()`, `lapply()` and `tapply()`--takes a series of elements and applies a given function to it. The function to be applied can be defined within the 'apply' function.  

"apply" functions take X, and applies a function to each element along the length of X (with the exception of `apply()`, which can apply the function along an array, and `tapply()`: see below). Each apply-family function varies slightly in its syntax or output format:

* `lapply()` returns the output as a list
* `sapply()` returns the output in the simplest format possible (e.g., it will be a vector if the output is a series of numbers)
* `vapply()` allows you to pre-specify a type of return value.
* `apply()` is slightly different in that it allows you to apply the function on an array--e.g., you can apply a function on rows of a matrix, or columns, or on each cell.
* `tapply()` applies a function to an variable in a dataframe grouped by a factor. (*I don't think I ever really use this one because I prefer to use the `group_by()` %>% `summarise()` pipeline from dplyr*)

### 1.1 Applying a function to a set of elements using `sapply()` and `lapply()`

#### 1.1.1: The basic difference between `sapply()` and `lapply()`
Here, we will use the `sapply()` function, which can take a series of elements, run a function on it, and then save the output in the simplest format ("s" in "sapply" is for "simplify").
\
Let's try out a really simple application:
```{r}
sapply(1:5, function(x) x*2)
```
Here, what we did was to:

(1) Take each element of `1:10` (integers from 1 to 10) and multiply each element by 2
(2) Store the output in the simplest form, which is a vector


Compare that with the `lapply()` function, which saves the output as a list.
```{r, eval=T}
lapply(1:5, function(x) x*2)
```


Here's another example:
```{r}
var=c(1,2,3)
sapply(1:10, function(x) x*var)
```
What have we done here?

(1) Set up an object called `var`, which is a vector of three numbers: 1, 2 and 3
(2) Then, take each element of `1:10` and multiply by `var`, which itself is 3 numbers. 
(3) Organize the results as a matrix, which is the simplest format to store a 2-dimensional set of numbers. In this case, there will be 3 rows of 10 numbers. 


Again, compare this result with the output of `lapply()` (output not shown):
```{r, eval=F}
var=c(1,2,3)
lapply(1:10, function(x) x*var)
```

So you can see that the output of `sapply()` is more user-friendly than the output of `lapply()` in general. 

#### 1.1.2. `lapply()` is really useful when your output is complex, like a model output of dataframe:

`lapply()` is really useful when you want to apply a function whose output is not a neat set of values.  

As an example, let's use the `lapply()` function to run a linear regression on a list of dataframes. First, we will create such a list by "splitting" the familiar `iris` dataset by species (output not shown):
```{r, results='hide'}
iris.list=split(iris, iris$Species)
iris.list
```
Now we have a list object with three dataframes. Let's now use the `lapply()` function to conduct the same linear regression model `Petal.Length~Sepal.Length` on each dataset. The output will be the `anova()` tables that show the F-statistic and overall model fits. 
```{r}
spp.mods=lapply(iris.list, function(x) lm(Petal.Length~Sepal.Length, data=x))
spp.mods
```


Now, let's then use the `lapply()` function again to get the summary:

```{r}
spp.mods.summary=lapply(spp.mods, function(x) summary(x))
spp.mods.summary
```


#### 1.1.3. You can use `sapply()` to efficiently extract the coefficients from a series of models stored in a list.

Every model output and/or summary objects contain lots of information. Let's see what is in the model summary for "setosa" (the first element of the spp.mods.summary list) using the function `str()`:
```{r}
str(spp.mods.summary[[1]])
```
You can see there are lots of info in here. Let's extract the "estimate" of the --i.e., the slope of the relationship. This value is stored inside the "coefficients" section of the summary. If you look at the output above, you can kind of see that the coefficients are arranged in a matrix of 2 rows (intercept and Sepal.Length) and 4 columns (Estimate, Std. Error, t-value, and p-value). So, the slope of the relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length is in the 2nd row, 1st column. 

Use this knowledge and an `sapply()` function to get those slopes!
```{r}
sapply(spp.mods.summary, function(x) x$coefficients[2,1])
```

You can see that the three species vary in their relationships between sepal length and petal length. 
Here's one way to visualize it simply using ggplot (you can just use the original iris data set to do this):
```{r, message=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  facet_wrap(~Species)
```
You can see how the slopes of "versicolor" and "virginica" are steeper than for "setosa".

### 1.2 `tapply()` (and comparing it to `aggregate()` and dplyr)
The `tapply()` function applies a function to a set of values that are grouped by some factor. This is pretty much the same as the `aggregate()` function, but the output format is different. 
As a demo, let's first set up a dataframe:
```{r}
fac=c(rep("A", 4), rep("B", 4), rep("C", 4))
num=1:12
dat=data.frame(num, fac)
dat
```

Now, we'll sum the values associated each factor (A, B or C). We'll do this using `tapply()`,  `aggregate()`, and the dplyr pipeline `group_by() %>% summarise()` and compare the outputs:
```{r}
output_tapply=tapply(dat$num, list(dat$fac), sum)
output_aggregate=aggregate(num, list(fac=fac), sum)
output_dplyr=dat %>% group_by(fac) %>% summarise(sum(num))
```

Let's see what `tapply()` did:
```{r}
output_tapply
class(output_tapply)
```
You can see that `tapply()` returns an array (in this case, since it's a one-dimensional array, it is basically a vector) with the names of the elements as the factor you used to group the values.

How about what `aggregate()` did?:
```{r}
output_aggregate
class(output_aggregate)
```

As you can see, `aggregate()` returns a dataframe with the factor as one column and values as a second column.

Finally, let's what the dplyr pipeline of `group_by() %>% summarise()` did:
```{r}
output_dplyr
```

This is essentially the same as `aggregate()` but in a tibble format.

### 1.3 Working with arrays using `apply()`
The `apply()` function is useful when you want to apply a function on an array (i.e., an n-dimensional set of numbers). Here, the syntax is apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...), where X is a matrix or array, MARGIN is the direction in which the function will applied—for a matrix, `MARGIN=1` indicates rows, and `MARGIN=2` indicates columns. For example:

```{r}
m=matrix(1:20, nrow=5, byrow=TRUE) 
m
apply(m,1,sum) #sum the rows
apply(m,2,sum) #sum the columns

```

Or you can set the margin to `c(1,2)` to apply a function to row/column combinations (i.e., each cell)
```{r}
apply(m,c(1,2),function(x) x^2)
```

Where `apply()` really shines is when working with larger-dimensional arrays. For example, consider a 3x4x5 3-D array. 

![](images/array.png){width="50%"}
We can sum across each of those dimensions:
```{r}
a=array(1:60, dim=c(5, 4, 3)) 
```
This creates a 3-dimensional array that is 5 values high, 4 values wide, and 3 values deep. 

The first "layer" of this matrix along dimension 1 (i.e., the matrix you can see on the front face of the diagram) would be:
```{r}
a[,,1]
```

The second "layer" would be:
```{r}
a[,,2]
```

etc...

Now, let's try out the `apply()` function along each dimension. First, let's calculate the sum across the "depth" dimension... This should return three values:
```{r}
apply(a, 3, sum)
```

This corresponds to the sums of each matrix if we sliced the matrices like I'm showing on the diagram above:
```{r}
sum(a[,,1])
sum(a[,,2])
sum(a[,,3])
```

If we want to sum the matrices as we cut the array along the "height" dimension (i.e., along rows), we should get 5 values:
```{r}
apply(a, 1, sum)
```

If we sum the matrices as we cut the array along the "width" dimension (i.e., along columns), we should get 4 values:
```{r}
apply(a, 2, sum)
```

We can also sum the array along two dimensions. Let's say we want to "collapse" the array into the 5-row x 4-column matrix--i.e., we sum each corresponding cell of the three "layers" of the matrices in the figure above: 
```{r}
apply(a, c(1,2), sum)
```

## 2. For-Loops

A “for loop” is another way to repeat a function or series of functions many times. The idea here is to request that an index (e.g., i) take on a series of values, and that a lines of commands are executed as many times as there are different values of i.

### 2.1. Set up an empty object (e.g., vector or list) to store the values in:
Here’s a simple example for just repeating a command 5 times:
```{r}
for (i in 1:5) print(i*2)
```

Sometimes, it is useful to store the results of a loop to an object. Here, let’s repeat the above command, but we will save the result as a vector. To do this, we will have to first create an empty vector and then request that the output of the command is stored in order. Here, I recommend that you first establish the number of iterations you want to run the command. You’ll see what you mean here:
```{r}
times=5 
v=numeric(length=times)
for (i in 1:times) v[i]=i*2
v
```

### 2.2. If the output of each loop is a vector, then you have to store the output in a matrix of the appropriate size:

Let's say you want to multiply a vector of numbers 1 through 10 by a series of numbers 1 through 5. Then, your output needs to be a matrix that is 5 x 10. Here, I'll set up an empty matrix with 5 rows and 10 columns to save the output:
```{r}
times=5 
m=matrix(nrow=times, ncol=10)
for (i in 1:times) m[i,]=(1:10)*i
m
```

### 2.3. You can use loops with output as a list to run a series of complex tasks:

Let's take the same example as we used in the `lapply()` example (Section 1.1 above). We'll split the iris dataset by species, then run a series of linear regressions with Sepal Length as the predictor variable and Petal Length as the response variable:

Let's just do the `split()` function again to make sure we have the same setup:
```{r}
iris.list=split(iris, iris$Species)
iris.list
```

Now, use loops to run the analyses. Here, I'm going to save the output as a list. To set up an empty list, all I have to do is `list()`:

```{r}
spp.mods.loop=list()
for(i in 1:length(iris.list)){
  spp.mods.loop[[i]]=lm(Petal.Length~Sepal.Length, data=iris.list[[i]])
}
spp.mods.loop
```

We can generate the model summaries and extract the slopes in the same loop if we want:

```{r}
spp.mods.summary.loop=list()
slopes.loop=vector(length=length(iris.list))
for(i in 1:length(iris.list)){
  spp.mods.summary.loop[[i]]=summary(spp.mods.loop[[i]])
  slopes.loop[i] = spp.mods.summary.loop[[i]]$coefficients[2,1]
}
```

Here are the model summaries:
```{r}
spp.mods.summary.loop
```

Here are the slopes:
```{r}
slopes.loop
```
